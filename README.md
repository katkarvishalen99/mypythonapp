# Problem statement for POC-2:-
 
Use a web-app as business logic (any sample app based on java/pythonâ€¦...etc.) and build a DockerFile using the same for all the relevant dependencies and packages needed at the runtime for the application to run.

Build a customized docker image using the above problem statement and deploy the same using manifest objects onto the Kubernetes cluster.

The above-mentioned app should be exposed using Kubernetes ingress object and should be accessible via browser session.
